# Low Carbon Consumption

The source of data for this visualization is from OurWorldInData which in turn is adapted from BP Statistical Review of World Energy. The data contains percentage of energy production from each of the individual sources like coal, oil, gas, nuclear, wind, hydropower, solar and other renewable energies by country from 1965 to 2019. 

Purpose of this visualization is to understand the trend in energy consumption from different energy sources like coal, oil, gas and low-carbon sources as a whole. The visualization also analyzes the changes in each of the different low-carbon sources like nuclear, solar, wind, hydropower and other renewable sources (bioenergy, geothermal and wave and tidal) over the years across the world and in different countries. This helps us to understand whether we are making a progress in consuming more low-carbon energy sources and are shifting towards a clean energy world. In addition to this, the visualization provides the top 10 low-carbon producers in the world.
